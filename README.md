# Prediction

Prediction of student behavior has been a prominant area of research in learning analytics and a major concern for higher education institutions and ed tech companies alike. It is the bedrock of methodology with the world of cognitive tutors and these methods have been exported to other areas within the education technology landscape. The ability to predict what a student is likely to do in the future so that interventions can be tailored has seen major growth and investment though not quite the pay off many institutions were hoping for. Although some institutions, such as George Washington University and Purdue University, have seen success around student drop out we are yet to see widespread adoption of these approaches as they tend to be highly institution specific and require very concrete outcomes to be useful. 

## Goals for this Unit
* Be able to discuss different uses for prediction algorithms in education
* Be able to discuss the theory behind the C4.5 and ID3 classification algorithm
* Be able to discuss the theory behind the Random Forest algorithm and the issues it seeks to solve
* Construct a classification model to predict student dropout and state validation metrics for the model
