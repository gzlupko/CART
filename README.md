# Overview 

This project implements and compares three decision tree models - C5.0, C5.4 and CART - to predict student drop out in an academic setting. 

## Goals for this Project 

* Construct classification models to predict student dropout and state validation metrics for the model
* Compare classification models on appropriate metrics

## Tasks for this Unit

In this unit you will be working towards buildimg models to predict student course dropout and then comparing those models. As background to this task please read over the follwing materials and watch the methodological videos. If you find any other useful materials please add them under **Additional Materials** at the end of the this page and pull request the change back to this repo.

## Data 

Data for this project was accessed through the University of Michigan Open Data Set.
